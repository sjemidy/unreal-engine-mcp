## Update 02/14/2026

---

This repository contains the **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for Unreal Engine, a powerful tool for controlling Unreal through AI clients like Claude, Cursor, and other MCP Hosts.

We've also built **The Flop Agent**, a fully autonomous AI agent that runs inside Unreal and goes far beyond the MCP server with full Blueprint editing, world building, and chat directly in the editor.

## FLop Agent v0.7 Now Released - [https://flopperam.com/](https://flopperam.com/)

### FULL BLUEPRINT CREATION AND EDITING
Full Blueprint creation and modification is now available inside the Unreal Editor. The agent goes beyond analysis and directly builds and edits Blueprint logic from natural language. You describe what you want. The agent handles structure, nodes, connections, and verification.

**You can:**
- Create new Blueprints from scratch
- Add or modify variables, components, events, and functions
- Update graph logic and node connections
- Expand existing systems without manually wiring everything
- Automatically compile and validate changes after edits

The agent analyzes the Blueprint, plans the edits, executes them in the editor, then compiles to confirm everything works. Blueprint iteration speed increases dramatically when you remove manual node wiring from the loop. This is the first iteration of our Blueprint modification, more improvements are in progress.

### CHAT RIGHT INSIDE UNREAL
The agent runs in an embedded browser directly in the Unreal Editor. Open the FlopAI panel and chat while you work on your scene—no switching windows.

### UNREAL VERSION SUPPORT
v0.7 supports Unreal Engine 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7.

### BUILDING AND WORLD CREATION
The agent executes complex multi-step builds: creating materials, placing actors, building structures, and verifying as it goes. With premium reasoning models (e.g. Claude Opus 4.5), you can drive full environments from a single prompt.

### 3D GENERATION QUALITY TIERS
Text and image to 3D has three quality levels: **Good** (fast iteration), **High Quality** (balanced), and **Very High Quality** (maximum detail, longer generation).

### DOCUMENTATION
Full docs are at [flopperam.com/docs](https://flopperam.com/docs)—installation, agent modes, 3D generation, Blueprint editing, and examples. Make sure you're running the latest Flop AI plugin inside Unreal to use these features.

## Featured Capabilities

### Complete Blueprint Visual Scripting

**Program Blueprints entirely through AI** with comprehensive node creation, graph management, and variable systems.

```bash
# Create complex Blueprint logic with control flow, variables, and functions
> "Create a Blueprint with a health system that tracks damage and triggers a death event"
→ create_blueprint() + create_variable() + add_node() + connect_nodes()

# Support for 23+ node types across 6 categories:
# Control Flow: Branch, Comparison, Switch (Byte/Enum/Integer), ExecutionSequence
# Data: VariableGet, VariableSet, MakeArray
# Casting: DynamicCast, ClassDynamicCast, CastByteToEnum
# Utility: Print, CallFunction, Select, SpawnActor
# Specialized: Timeline, GetDataTableRow, AddComponentByClass, Self, Knot
# Animation: PlayAnimation, StopAnimation, Timeline nodes
```

**Advanced Blueprint Features:**
- **Function Management**: Create custom functions with inputs/outputs, rename, and delete
- **Variable System**: Full property control (public/private, replication, tooltips, ranges, units)
- **Node Properties**: Dynamic pin management, type modification, semantic editing
- **Graph Analysis**: Read complete Blueprint content, analyze execution flow, inspect variables
- **Connection System**: Wire nodes together with automatic type validation

### World Building & Architecture  
```bash
# Create massive futuristic cities with skyscrapers, flying cars, and advanced infrastructure
> "Build a massive futuristic city with towering skyscrapers"
→ create_town(town_size="massive", architectural_style="futuristic", building_density=0.95)

# Build complex multi-room houses with windows, doors, and roofs
> "Create a Victorian mansion complex with east and west wing houses."
→ construct_house(house_style="mansion", width=1500, height=900)
```

### Intelligent Mazes
```bash
# Generate solvable mazes with guaranteed paths using recursive backtracking
> "Make a 15x15 maze with high walls"
→ create_maze(rows=15, cols=15, wall_height=4, cell_size=250)
```

## Lightning-Fast Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Unreal Engine 5.5+** 
- **Python 3.12+**
- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf)

### 1. Setup Options

**Option A: Use the Pre-Built Project (Recommended for Quick Start)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flopperam/unreal-engine-mcp.git
cd unreal-engine-mcp

# Open the pre-configured project
# Double-click FlopperamUnrealMCP/FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject
# or open it through Unreal Engine launcher

# The plugin is already installed and enabled!
```

**Option B: Add Plugin to Your Existing Project**
```bash
# Copy the plugin to your project
cp -r UnrealMCP/ YourProject/Plugins/

# Enable in Unreal Editor
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable → Restart Editor
```

**Option C: Install for All Projects**
```bash
# Copy to Engine plugins folder (available to all projects)
cp -r UnrealMCP/ "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.5/Engine/Plugins/"

# Enable in any project through the Plugin Browser
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable
```

#### Extra steps for Mac
If you're on macOS and Unreal Engine fails to open the project due to compilation errors, you'll need to manually compile the C++ plugin first. To do so, follow these steps:

##### Step 1: Check Your Xcode Version

```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcrun --show-sdk-version
```

Note your Xcode version number (e.g., `26.0.1`, `16.0`, `15.2`, etc.). If your version is newer than 16.0, you'll need to patch the Unreal Engine SDK configuration.

##### Step 2: Patch Unreal Engine SDK Configuration

Edit the file at your Unreal Engine installation (replace `UE_5.X` with your version):

```bash
# Path to edit:
/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.X/Engine/Config/Apple/Apple_SDK.json
```

Update the following values:

**Change 1:** Update `MaxVersion` to support your Xcode version
```json
{
  "MaxVersion": "YOUR_XCODE_VERSION.9.0",  // e.g., "26.9.0" if you have Xcode 26.x
}
```
Replace `YOUR_XCODE_VERSION` with your major Xcode version from Step 1.

**Change 2:** Add LLVM version mapping for your Xcode version (add to the `AppleVersionToLLVMVersions` array)
```json
{
  "AppleVersionToLLVMVersions": [
    "14.0.0-14.0.0",
    "14.0.3-15.0.0",
    "15.0.0-16.0.0",
    "16.0.0-17.0.6",
    "16.3.0-19.1.4",
    "YOUR_XCODE_VERSION.0.0-19.1.4"  // e.g., "26.0.0-19.1.4" for Xcode 26.x
  ]
}
```
Replace `YOUR_XCODE_VERSION` with your major Xcode version from Step 1.

##### Step 3: Compile the Plugin

Run the Unreal Build Tool to compile the project:

```bash
"/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.X/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Mac/Build.sh" \
  UnrealEditor Mac Development \
  -Project="/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/FlopperamUnrealMCP/FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject" \
  -WaitMutex
```

Replace:
- `UE_5.X` with your Unreal Engine version (e.g., `UE_5.5`)
- `/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/` with the actual path to your cloned repository

##### Step 4: Open the Project

Once compilation succeeds, you can open `FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject` in Unreal Engine.

### 2. Launch the MCP Server

```bash
cd Python
uv run unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py
```

### 3. Configure Your AI Client

Add this to your MCP configuration:

**Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
**Claude Desktop**: `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json`
**Windsurf**: `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/Python",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that on Mac, and sometimes on Windows, you may have to replace the "uv" string passed as the value to "command" in the above `mcp.json` file with the exact absolute path to the uv executable. To get that path, run one of these commands:
- Mac: `which uv`
- Windows: `where uv`

### 4. Start Building!

```bash
> "Create a medieval castle with towers and walls"
> "Generate a town square with fountain and buildings"
> "Make a challenging maze for players to solve"
```
